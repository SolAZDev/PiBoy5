# PiBoy5
PipBoy HTML5 For Raspberry Pi (Originally) And Mobile! By Fans, for fans!

##About
Originally a personal project for two guys (Me and my friend, Red/Mr.Canvas), from the iea to make a Pip-Boy arose the need to make a custom one! Originally made to recreate and imitiate the look, and feel of the
Pip-Boy 3000 Mk.IV from FO4, made to be customizable for each user. This is in no way related to any Fallout game, nor the series, nor Bethesda itself. And is, by entirety, a fan-made project.
